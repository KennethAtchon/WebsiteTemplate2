# Checklist Incomplete Items — Prioritized

**Last reviewed:** Feb 21, 2026  
**Source checklists:** `security.md`, `production-readiness.md`, `testing.md`, `monitoring.md`, `performance.md`, `documentation.md`, `compliance.md`

Priority levels: **P1 — Blocker** (must fix before going live), **P2 — High** (fix soon after launch), **P3 — Medium** (next quarter), **P4 — Low** (nice to have / situational)

---

## P1 — Blockers (must complete before production launch)

These items are either security risks, hard deployment requirements, or directly prevent the app from working in production.

**What's left before going live (manual steps only):**
1. Create Railway project, link GitHub repo, set root dir to `project/`
2. Add Railway PostgreSQL + Redis services
3. Fill in all environment variables in Railway Dashboard (see `deployment.md`)
4. Add custom domain in Railway Dashboard → point Cloudflare CNAME → set SSL to "Full (Strict)"
5. Add `RAILWAY_TOKEN` + `PRODUCTION_URL` to GitHub Secrets
6. Enable branch protection on `master` (required status checks)
7. Enable Railway PostgreSQL backups (Pro plan)
8. Accept DPAs with Stripe, Firebase, Railway, Cloudflare (see `compliance-financial-legal.md`)
9. `git push origin master` — Railway deploys, health check runs
10. Validate security headers at securityheaders.com
11. Set up uptime monitor in Better Uptime / Pingdom
12. Accept/configure log aggregation (Railway Observability or Better Stack)
