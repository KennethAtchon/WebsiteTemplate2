# Architecture Documentation

Architecture docs are split into two categories:

- **`core/`** — Reusable patterns: auth, API design, database, security, performance, error handling, logging. These apply to any project.
- **`domain/`** — Template-specific business logic: subscription tiers, calculator system, admin dashboard, account management.

Start with [overview.md](./overview.md) for the full tech stack and system design.
